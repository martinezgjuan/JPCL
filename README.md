# Java Programming Contest Library

JPCL is a java library intended for programming contests.

The diffent classes and methods are implemented with the goal of being able to easily and rapidly copy and paste the desired portions of code in the solutions of the contest problems. This (unfortunately) often results in a lack of object-oriented design and a considerable number of global variables.

A programming contest template is also included, containing (as a compact inner-class) the essential methods needed for efficient IO operations which are vital in many on-line contests.

Most classes/methods have been tested with problems from online judges and such problems will often be mentioned in the classes/methods documentations.
